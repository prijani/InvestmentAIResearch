# OpenAI Stock Market Prediction Evaluation

> **Note:** The AI-based financial advisor project is separate and not included here.

## Purpose
This repository evaluates the ability of OpenAI’s language models to analyze and predict stock market trends. It queries GPT models for structured S&P 500 stock recommendations, attaches real historical prices, and assesses model accuracy and reliability for practical financial analysis.

## Features

- Queries OpenAI GPT models (default `gpt-4o-mini`) for 10 S&P 500 stock recommendations.
- Enforces strict JSON-only responses for reproducibility.
- Attaches the most recent end-of-month closing price for each stock using `yfinance`.
- Saves results in timestamped JSON files under `outputs/`.
- Maintains a SHA-256 hash log for every saved output.
- Handles malformed or non-JSON responses safely for debugging.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment
3. Install dependencies
4. Create a .env file in the project root with your OpenAI API key

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.13+
- Packages:
  - `openai`
  - `python-dotenv`
  - `yfinance`

---

## Notes

Confidence scores are generated by the model but are not verified against actual market performance.
This repository is intended for research and educational purposes only. It is not financial advice.

---

## Usage
Run main script: "python main.py"
- Outputs are saved in outputs/ with timestamped filenames.
- SHA-256 hashes of each output are appended to hash_log.txt.
- Errors and malformed JSON responses are logged for troubleshooting.

---

## Installation Support & Dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install openai python-dotenv yfinance #dependencies
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
